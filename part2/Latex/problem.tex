\section{Problem Description}

In this project the task is to solve the two-dimensional poisson problem as stated below.
\begin{align}
	-\nabla^2 u &= f  \text{ in } \Omega = (0,1)\times(0,1) \\
	u &=  0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega
\end{align}
%
The problem is solved using a fast diagonalization method. The derivation of the method can be found in \cite{poisson} ,
and the system of equation to be solved can be written as 
\begin{align}
	\underline{T} \; \underline{U} + 	\underline{U} \; \underline{T} = \underline{G} 	
	\label{eq:Matrix}
\end{align}
where $\underline{T}$ is the discrete second order partial differential operator in one direction, 
$\underline{G}$ is the discrete loading function multiplied with the steplength squared $h^2$ and $\underline{U}$ is the discrete solution
to the problem.
and the method can be summed up into the following three steps:


\begin{description}
	\item[step 1  -  $O(n^2\log(n))$] \hfill \\ \hfill \\
		Compute $\underline{\tilde{G}} = \underline{Q}^T\underline{G} \; \underline{Q} $    -    two matrix-matrix products 
		\hfill \\
	\item[step 2  -  $O(n^2)$] \hfill \\ \hfill \\
		Compute $\tilde{u}_{i,j} = \frac{\tilde{g}_{i,j}}{\lambda_i+\lambda_j}$    -    scalar addition and divition
		\hfill \\
	\item[step 3  -  $O(n^2log(n))$] \hfill \\ \hfill \\
		Compute $\underline{U} = \underline{Q}\underline{\tilde{U}} \; \underline{Q}^T $    -     two matrix-matrix products 
\end{description}

$\underline{Q}$ and $\underline{\Lambda}$ contains the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the discrete 
second order partial differential operator. 

Step 1 and 3 are solved using the infamous fast sine transform.
